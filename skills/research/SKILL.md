The project root is: !`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`

Read `$ARGUMENTS` in depth — understand how it works deeply, what it does, and all its specificities. Study the intricacies, go through everything, trace the full flow.

When done, write a detailed report of your learnings and findings in `research.md` **at the project root**. The report should cover:

- Purpose
- Architecture
- Key files
- Data flow
- Dependencies
- Edge cases
- Any potential issues discovered

Do not propose changes or implement anything — this is purely a research phase.
